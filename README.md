# Energy Alabama Knowledge Base Plugin

A comprehensive knowledge base system for Energy Alabama with custom post types, taxonomies, and search functionality.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer
- WordPress development environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:erik-itb/ea-kb.git
cd ea-kb
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

3. The setup includes WordPress stubs for IDE support, which resolves VSCode errors for WordPress core functions like `plugin_dir_url()`, `wp_enqueue_script()`, etc.

### IDE Configuration

The project includes VSCode configuration (`.vscode/settings.json`) that:
- Enables WordPress function recognition
- Configures Intelephense with WordPress stubs
- Sets up proper PHP validation

### Code Analysis

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```
